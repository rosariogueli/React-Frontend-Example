Notes:

My strategy included splitting the provided layout into separate reusable components. I have not used any external state managements tools, I am using React internal state because this is a small application, keeping the state and methods inside the App.js file. The other reason I've used the internal state is because I didn't want to change the build.

I really loved building this App. Please see below some ideas that could make it even more user friendly!
The following information was not provided in the test spec, but I thought it would be nice to share ideas: 
- Woundn't it be nice to have a sorting function by: Latest added / Oldest added / Alphabetically etc.? 
- Wouldn't it be useful if we could change the order of selected items?
